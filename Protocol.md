# FTtP 2.5 Respirator CRASH Test Protocol

## Instructions

### *For tests conducted with 2.5-cm jaw spacers*

1. Prepare your quantitative fit testing (QNFT) setup, ensuring a stable ambient particle count.  

2. Place the blue 2.5-cm spacer in your mouth.

3. Before donning the respirator, practice **2.5-cm jaw cycles** by manipulating the spacer within your mouth as follows:

    **↕** Position the spacer so it stands vertically between your upper and lower front teeth (jaw open 2.5 cm).

    **↔** Return the spacer to a default horizontal position behind your teeth (jaw closed).
	
4. Don the respirator, adjust the nosewire, and do not start the test for at least three minutes. Relax, browse phone, etc.

5. Begin testing (see [**12-Exercise Set List**](#12-exercise-set-list)) and record the fit factor for each exercise in a spreadsheet (Excel or one you can export to .xlsx).

6. For each respirator, please conduct **two** 12-exercise sets, readjusting the mask **only** between completed sets.

7. Optional: For each 12-exercise set, find the harmonic mean fit factor (HMFF) using the spreadsheet formula `=HARMEAN()`

8. Email the .xlsx file to FitTestMyPlanet@gmail.com to be part of the FTtP2.5 global survey. Thank you!
